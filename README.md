test task by design, no animations. Stack: JS/jQuery, CSS, HTML5.

## Ideas for improving
1) use nuxt.js, it simplify the developing, simplify solving problems with Сross-browser and add opportunity to use my experience with current tool.
2) if not use nuxt.js, also, is a good idea to use SCSS and Pug, it could improve the code organization


*) Сross-browser: need to setup webpack and autoprefixer for the css, and babel or jQuery for the JS.
